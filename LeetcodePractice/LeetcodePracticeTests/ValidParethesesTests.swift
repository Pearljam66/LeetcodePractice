 Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

 An input string is valid if:

 Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
 Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
 Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

 Example 1:
 Input: s = "()"
 Output: true

 Example 2:
 Input: s = "()[]{}"
 Output: true
 Example 3:

 Input: s = "(]"
 Output: false

 Constraints:

 1 <= s.length <= 104
 s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.
